## Azure IoT

### Azure Stream Analytics[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/stream-analytics/)
* Azure Stream Analytics is a managed event-processing engine set up real-time analytic computations on streaming data
* The data can come from devices, sensors, web sites, social media feeds, applications, infrastructure systems, and more
* Use Stream Analytics to examine high volumes of data streaming from devices or processes, extract information from that data stream, identify patterns, trends, and relationships.
* The data can be ingested into Azure from a device using an Azure event hub or IoT hub. The data can also be pulled from a data store like Azure Blob Storage.
* Stream Analytics can handle up to 1 GB of incoming data per second
* Response to analysis:
    * Send a command to change device settings. 
    * Send data to a monitored queue for further action based on findings (such as event hubs, Azure Service Bus, queues)
    * Send data to a Power BI dashboard.
    * Send data to storage like Data Lake Store, Azure SQL Database, or Azure Blob storage.
* Stream Analytics provides a SQL-like language for creating transformations (SQL DSL)
* Azure provides multiple solutions for analyzing streaming data: Azure Streaming Analytics and Apache Storm on Azure HDInsight
* Stream Analytics pricing is based on volume of data processed and the number of streaming units required per hour that the job is running
* Apache Storm on HDInsight pricing is cluster-based, and is charged based on the time the cluster is running, independent of jobs deployed
* Stream Analytics enables developers to use Tumbling, Hopping and Sliding windows to perform temporal operations on streaming data

* A field gateway can:
    * Run analytics on the edge.
    * Make time-sensitive decisions to reduce latency.
    * Provide device management services.
    * Enforce security and privacy constraints.
    * Perform protocol translation.

### Notification Hub[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/notification-hubs/notification-hubs-push-notification-overview)
* Azure Notification Hubs provide an easy-to-use, multi-platform, scaled-out push engine.
* a single cross-platform API call to send targeted and personalized push notifications to any mobile platform from any cloud or on-premises backend
* Push notifications is a form of app-to-user communication where users of mobile apps are notified of certain desired information, usually in a pop-up or dialog box
* Push notifications are delivered through platform-specific infrastructures called Platform Notification Systems (PNSes)
* Notification Hubs is offered in three tiersâ€”free, basic and standard. Base charge and quotas are applied at the namespace level[^](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/details/notification-hubs/)

Challenges of Push Notifications:
* Platform dependency
* Scale - device tokens must be refreshed upon every app launch, broadcast support
* Routing - backend must maintain a registry to associate devices with interest groups, users, properties, etc.

Notification Hub advantages:
* Cross platforms - iOS, Android, Windows, and Kindle and Baidu
* Cross backends - Cloud or on-premises, .NET, Node.js, Java, etc
* Rich set of delivery patterns:
    * Broadcast to one or multiple platforms
    * Push to device
    * Push to user
    * Push to segment with dynamic tags
    * Localized push
    * Silent push
    * Scheduled push
    * Direct push
    * Personalized push
* Rich telemetry
* Scalability
* Security - SAS or federated authentication

 App Service Mobile Apps has built-in support for push notifications using Notification Hubs.
